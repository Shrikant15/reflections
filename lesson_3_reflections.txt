When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

Remote repository is needed when we need to share and collaborate with other
folks/team members/community members. We would need to provide our changes as
well as access changes made by others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Not every change in the remote github repository would be relevant for us.
We would need to understand based on commits , hence manual pull would help us
in making changes on the local repository unknowingly.
